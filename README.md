# BIGGUN Network Monitoring Tool

A robust and efficient network monitoring tool designed to help administrators track the health and performance of their networks, identify issues, and ensure smooth operations.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors network traffic, devices, and services in real-time.
- **Alerting System**: Configurable alerts for high latency, packet loss, and other network issues.
- **Dashboard**: Interactive and easy-to-read dashboard to view network status, performance metrics, and alerts.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Visualize traffic patterns, bandwidth usage, and network bottlenecks.
- **Device Discovery**: Automatically detects devices connected to the network.
- **Historical Reports**: View historical network performance data and generate reports for analysis.
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: Supports multiple network protocols like HTTP, ICMP (Ping), SNMP, and more.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)
- Network access to the devices you want to monitor

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/engdmilit05/network-monitoring-tool.git
    ```

2. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd network-monitoring-tool
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Configure your network parameters in the `config/config.yml` file.

4. Run the tool:
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

5. Access the web interface:
    - Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to access the dashboard.

## Configuration

The configuration file `config/config.yml` allows you to adjust various parameters, including:

- **Network IP Ranges**: Define the IP ranges to be monitored.
- **Communications Ports**: Customise communication ports per application. 
- **Alert Thresholds**: Set thresholds for latency, packet loss, and bandwidth usage that will trigger alerts.
- **SMTP Settings**: Configure SMTP settings to send email alerts.
- **SNMP Settings**: Configure SNMP for monitoring network devices.

## Usage

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Once the tool is running, you will see real-time updates of the network performance on the dashboard.
- **Alerts**: You will receive notifications based on the thresholds you’ve set (e.g., if latency exceeds a certain value).
- **Reports**: You can generate reports from the historical data for further analysis.
